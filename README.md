# Template for notes: `mnotes`

This is a simple template for managing personal notes diaries and comments in raw text form that others can use as a start point for their own notes. I call it `mnotes` as abbreviation of: my notes.

To start managing your notes:
-----------------------------
1. Create your own git server.
2. Create your own <empty> repository for your notes.
3. Clone this new repository into your own working computer.
4. Open your favorite text editor and start making your own notes.

Hints:
------
- Let's use the name for your repository also `mnotes`.
- If you do not have a folder where all repositories are stored I would suggest to use `/var/git` folder.
  - For example:
    - /var/git/<git-server>/<company>/<repository>
    - /var/git/github.com/example/repository-name
  - On Windows you can use for example `C:\_GIT` but try to use a Unix-like system.  
- I prefer sublime for my notes to not mix vscode or atom with this stuff.

This repository is a collection of logical structure of the notes, tools that I use to manage it and basic principles that I try to follow to make it clean, agile and usable.
